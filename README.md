# Dynamic workspace root and tasks based on subdirectory context

Browse to one of the subdirectories on this repo and open a workspace from there. Or you can also click on a button below!

# Details

A [.gitpod.yml](./.gitpod.yml) task is used to process `$GITPOD_WORKSPACE_CONTEXT_URL` variable. Later `code -r` command is used if a subdirectory was found on the CONTEXT_URL.

We can also run tasks conditionally based on the subdirectory context. (see the 2nd task in [.gitpod.yml](./.gitpod.yml) for example)
